This is a strong start. You’ve already framed most of the core surfaces (IR, CLI skeleton, devserver, runtime, component SDK, components, plugins, themes). Below is a high‑signal review with concrete next steps.

What’s great

Clear separation of concerns: Rust core (IR/validation/devserver), TS runtime, CE SDK, components, plugins, themes, examples.
IR v1 is coherent and matches the earlier spec; TOML examples line up with serde camelCase.
Runtime modules are modular (router, fragments, auto‑animate, theming, speaker view).
Plugins stdlib shows realistic capability use (rooms, storage, ui, telemetry).
Themes/tokens are thorough and print.css is thoughtful.
Top priority gaps to make “coolslides dev” render an example deck today

Load deck/slides into devserver state
Problem: /api/deck and /api/slide/:id return 404 because AppState.deck/slides are never populated.
Fix: on server startup, read slides.toml and content/*.slide.toml from CWD (or --dir), deserialize to DeckManifest/SlideDoc, store in AppState. Add a file watcher to refresh state and broadcast a “reload” WS message to the client.
2. Serve built JS/CSS assets the runtime expects

Problem: export HTML references /packages/runtime/dist/index.js and /packages/components/dist/index.js, but the server only serves /static.
Fix: mount ServeDir for:
packages/runtime/dist → /packages/runtime/dist
packages/components/dist → /packages/components/dist
themes/ → /themes Also ensure a workspace build runs (tsc --watch or a child process) in dev.
3. WebSocket room creation is broken

Bug: websocket_handler creates a new room if missing, but RoomManager::create_room generates a random UUID and doesn’t store it under the requested room_id; the requested room still doesn’t exist.
Fix: add ensure_room(room_id: String) to insert Room::new(room_id.clone()) keyed by room_id; call that from websocket_handler. Also accept role (presenter/audience) from querystring or a first “join” message.
4. Runtime init/deck bootstrap

Your runtime init tries /api/deck; once (1)(2) are fixed, it will hydrate. Keep the script tags with embedded JSON as a static fallback.
High‑ROI cleanup for v0.1

Import map and resolution

Today you hardcode script src paths. For portability, generate an import map from .slides/lock.json at export and inject it:
<script type="importmap">{ "imports": { "@coolslides/runtime": "/packages/runtime/dist/index.js", … } }</script>
In dev, serve a dynamic import map at /api/importmap and inject it in runtime/index.html.
Slide rendering and tag resolution

generate_slide_html builds the tag via cs-{name}. That will drift once names diverge from tags. Use the component manifest tag instead of a name→tag transform. Maintain a name→tag map during resolution.
Markdown slots

You html_escape() Markdown values (safe) but they won’t render as Markdown. Decide:
Either allow plain HTML here (rename kind: "html").
Or actually render Markdown (build-time in Rust with pulldown-cmark or comrak; client fallback optional).
Auto‑animate v1 polish

You FLIP transform geometry; add opacity tween for nicer perceived motion.
Respect per‑element overrides if present (e.g., data-auto-animate-duration on a node) in addition to slide‑level.
Handle font-size/line-height transitions via scale plus a color fade for text elements; otherwise size jumps can look harsh.
Add reduced‑motion unit test (ensures fade only).
Fragments and router coherence

router.ts toggles display via inline styles; theme.css expects [data-active]. Consider setting a data-active attribute so CSS transitions can apply consistently.
getSlideFragmentCount currently returns 1; wire it to fragments.getFragmentCount(slideEl).
Rooms: record/replay

Good skeleton. Add backpressure/rate limiting and a cap on message history per room. Persist recording to .slides/rooms/*.jsonl in dev.
PDF export

include_str! print.css is fine; but headless Chrome ignores most @page margin boxes. Expect no header/footer margin boxes; implement explicit page numbers in print DOM as a fallback.
Add “wait for window.coolslidesExportReady == true” before printing (you set it—great). Consider a per‑slide timeout with a visible warning on failure.
Architectural alignment notes

You opted for vanilla TypeScript Custom Elements for components (TitleSlide.ts, TwoColSlide.ts, etc.). That’s perfectly compatible with the plan. If you still want a Svelte authoring path, add a sibling package (components-svelte/) that compiles Svelte → custom elements and exports the same manifests.
Package manager: the repo uses npm workspaces (package-lock.json). Earlier we discussed pnpm, but consistency beats preference—sticking to npm is fine. Remove stray nested package-lock.json (packages/runtime/packages/components/package-lock.json) which looks accidental.
IR/spec consistency checks

TOML examples use modelVersion (camelCase), which matches #[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")] in Rust. Good.
DeckItem wiring:
Rust emits { "type": "ref", "ref": "id" }. Your TS type matches that (ref: string). Server-side code uses DeckItem::Ref { slide_id } (serde rename "ref")—that’s correct.
Validation: packages/coolslides_core/src/validation.rs is a good start, but you’re not validating props/slots against each component’s JSON Schema.
Next: add component schema validation (resolve the component manifest, validate with jsonschema-rs or valico) and emit CS codes (e.g., CS1005: Prop “title” required by TwoColSlide).
DX/CLI sharp edges

apps/cli prints “TODO” in every subcommand. For a usable MVP:
init: scaffold examples/basic-deck into target dir, write slides.toml, copy themes/default, link packages/* via workspace.
dev: spawn the devserver with cwd=project root; also spawn tsc --watch in packages/runtime and packages/components unless a --no-build flag is passed.
validate: run IR + schema + lockfile checks; print CS* codes with file/line when possible.
export html/pdf: call the devserver HTTP endpoints (or directly use export.rs) and write to the target.
add component/plugin: resolve package via npm (or file:), update a lockfile and generate/import map.
Security and capability stubs

Plugins declare capabilities, but the runtime doesn’t gate them yet. For v0.2:
Provide ctx.capabilities only for those declared and allowed by deck.manifest.
Add a simple CSP in export (default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img/media 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' for now).
In strict mode, block network.fetch to non-allowlisted origins; deny sensors by default.
A11y/perf

Good reduced motion hooks and tokens. Add:
Focus flow across fragments (ensure tab order skips hidden fragments).
Color contrast lint in validate (run computed contrast for the default theme).
Perf: warn in dev when a slide’s assets exceed a budget (e.g., 1.5 MB) or a single widget bundle > 200 KB.
Small correctness nits

apps/devserver/src/lib.rs → websocket_handler: creating the room if missing must use the provided room_id (see “Top priority gaps”).
component-sdk property decorator:
Boolean reflection uses empty attribute string for true (ok). Make sure removing attribute sets false (your converter handles that).
Array/Object attribute parsing assumes JSON; in PollWidget you also accept comma‑separated—good.
generate-manifests.js writes only TitleSlide manifest; add others or generate programmatically from class metadata.
CodeSlide’s SyntaxHighlighter is placeholder. Plan: pre-render with syntect in Rust at build/export; fallback to client at dev time only.
What to build next (in order)

Make dev usable end-to-end:
Implement file loading + watching; mount static dirs; fix rooms; basic import map.
Validation against component schemas; wire generate-manifests for all components.
Replace placeholder code highlighting with syntect in export; keep client fallback in dev.
Capability gating (rooms/ws, network, storage, ui) with a minimal CSP in export.
Tests: unit tests for IR parse/validate, auto‑animate reduced motion path, and a smoke E2E that loads examples/basic-deck, navigates, and exports a PDF.
Questions/decisions to lock

Do you want to keep “vanilla CE” as the default component authoring path and add Svelte later, or switch default to Svelte→CE now?

RILEY INPUT: I think keep vanilla CE for now and worry about svelte and other frameworks later

Import map vs bundling: for export, do you prefer an import map + loose files (simple), or a single bundled runtime/components file per deck (heavier build but fewer moving parts)?

RILEY INPUT: heavier single bundle preferred but open to other suggestions if it makes it easier

Where should decks read from by default in dev? CWD, or an explicit --project flag?

RILEY INPUT: i think CWD by default is fine
